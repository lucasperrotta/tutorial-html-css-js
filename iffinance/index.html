            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a]
            for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines
            the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
            languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents
            from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
            into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
            page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
            constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
            be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such
            as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
            elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
